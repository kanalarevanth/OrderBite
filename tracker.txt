Tech Stack Suggestions for Implementation
Frontend: React.js

Use React Router for navigation between pages (Dashboard, Transactions, Budgeting & Goals).
Material UI or Tailwind CSS for responsive, modern UI components.
Chart.js or Recharts for graphs (income vs expenses, trends, etc.).
Backend (for storing data):

Use Firebase Firestore for easy cloud-based storage, user authentication, and real-time updates.
Alternatively, you could use a Node.js + Express backend with MongoDB if you need more custom features.
Authentication: Firebase Authentication or Auth0 for handling user sign-ups and logins securely.

State Management:

Use React Context API or Redux for global state management (e.g., current user, transactions, budgets, etc.).
Notifications:

Use Firebase Cloud Messaging or Push Notifications for reminding users of upcoming bills or budget limits.
Deployment:

Deploy your app on Netlify, Vercel, or Firebase Hosting for easy CI/CD and global distribution.
